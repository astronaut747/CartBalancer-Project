# CartBalancer: Robust Inverted Pendulum Stabilization

## Project Overview
This academic project explores advanced control algorithms to stabilize an inverted pendulum on a moving cart. It compares the efficacy of H∞ and LQR controllers under varying conditions of noise and disturbances.

## Features
- Implementation and comparison of H∞ and LQR control strategies.
- Detailed analysis of controller response to environmental uncertainties.
- MATLAB simulations demonstrating practical applications.
