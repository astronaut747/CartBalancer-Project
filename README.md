# CartBalancer: Robust Inverted Pendulum Stabilization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on stabilizing an inverted pendulum on a cart using two advanced control methods: H∞ and LQR controllers. The goal is to maintain stability amid model uncertainties, sensor noise, and external disturbances.

## Technologies Used
- MATLAB

## Features
- Implementation of H∞ and LQR control algorithms.
- Analysis of system performance under various noise levels and disturbances.
- Evaluation of controller efficiency and system response time.

## Getting Started
To run this project, MATLAB is required. Load the provided scripts to analyze the controller performance and system dynamics.

## Controllers
- **H∞ Controller**: Optimizes robustness against disturbances.
- **LQR Controller**: Focuses on minimizing a cost function balancing state regulation and control effort.

## Results
The project demonstrates successful stabilization with detailed comparisons of the two controllers’ performance, emphasizing the trade-offs between robustness and efficiency.
